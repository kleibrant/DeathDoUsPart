# DeathDoUsPart
short vr game where the player is waking up, unknowing of what happens in his hallway, his health decreasing constantly.
ghost shows up with a collider attached making the player take extra damage over time, if you enter the ghost's second collider the player ends up in a game over scene, able to choose to wake up or not.
